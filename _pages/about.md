A passionate Software Engineer currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s in Computer Science** at **New York Universityâ€™s Courant Institute**, with prior experience as a **Software Engineer at Apple** and an ongoing internship at **Teradata**. My work bridges **systems engineering, compilers, and AI infrastructure**, focusing on building high-performance, scalable systems that solve real-world challenges.

At **Teradata**, Iâ€™m part of the **Query Optimizer Team**, where I design and implement **LLVM-based optimizations** and **vector search engines** for large-scale AI workloads. My recent work involves developing a **C++ HNSW index** and integrating it into the query engine, achieving 3Ã— throughput improvements and sub-second query times on 100M+ vectors. These efforts aim to bring intelligent, high-performance search capabilities to enterprise-scale data systems.

Previously at **Apple**, I worked in the **Cloud Infrastructure Platform organization**, developing full-stack and cloud-native systems supporting Appleâ€™s global production network. I built **observability platforms**, **Golang microservices**, and **Kubernetes orchestration pipelines** across AWS and GCP to improve operational visibility, deployment reliability, and system scalability. My experience at Apple shaped my **SRE and distributed systems mindset**â€”designing software thatâ€™s reliable, performant, and maintainable at scale.

Iâ€™m deeply interested in the **intersection of compilers, distributed systems, and AI compute**, exploring how low-level optimizations can power next-generation infrastructure for machine learning and data analytics. I thrive on solving performance bottlenecks, architecting systems that scale, and contributing to technology that drives measurable impact.

Outside of work, I enjoy diving into research-driven projectsâ€”from **GPU-accelerated embedding search** to **multicore performance analysis**â€”that merge theory with hands-on engineering. My goal is to keep learning, experimenting, and building technology that makes large-scale computation smarter, faster, and more efficient.
