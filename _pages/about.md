A passionate Software Engineer with three years of experience at Apple, specializing in designing scalable web solutions and optimizing cloud infrastructure. My expertise spans full-stack web, software development and deployments. At Apple, I developed key tools that significantly streamlined deployments and boosted system performance.

Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at New York University’s Courant Institute, where I am deepening my knowledge in Distributed Systems, Cloud Computing, Machine Learning and GPUs. My academic journey is driven by the desire to solve complex technical challenges and merge my practical experience with cutting-edge research to create impactful solutions. 

I am also passionate about exploring how technology can drive real-world change. My interests lie at the intersection of software engineering and large-scale systems, where I aim to contribute to building solutions that make a meaningful impact on industries and society. Whether it's solving infrastructure challenges or creating innovative cloud solutions, I thrive on delivering practical, high-impact results.

Always eager to connect with others who share similar passions or explore new opportunities. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing new ideas, please feel free to reach out!
