<b>Automated Traffic Light Control and Violation Detection System</b> <br>
Advisor: [Prof. Raghu B.A]<br>
* Developed an automated traffic light system using CCTV footage analysis, incorporating SVM for object prediction and ARIMA for signal timing to dynamically adjust signal durations based on real-time traffic density.<br>
* Implemented a violation detection mechanism using YOLOv3 for helmet detection and line-crossing during red signals, improving traffic rule enforcement.<br>
* Integrated EasyOCR for automatic license plate recognition (ANPR) to capture violators' license plates for further processing and enforcement. <br>
* Utilized machine learning models and SVM for vehicle classification and traffic density prediction, enhancing the efficiency of traffic management.<br>
* Built a full-stack solution using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow for real-time image and video processing from traffic camera feeds.<br>

<b>Mini Java Compiler</b> <br>
Advisor: [Prof. Preet Kanwal]<br>
* Led the development of a mini Java compiler using Lex for lexical analysis and Yacc for syntax and semantic analysis, supporting constructs like if-else and loops.<br>
* Generated intermediate code, optimized using techniques like constant folding and dead code elimination, and produced target MIPS assembly code.<br>
* Built an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent program structure, enabling efficient code generation and error handling.<br>
* Integrated code optimization techniques such as common subexpression elimination, improving performance of the generated code.<br>
* The compiler supported MIPS assembly code generation using Python for target code, enhancing the system's overall capability for handling basic Java constructs.

<b>Lie Detection AI System</b> <br>
Advisor: [Prof. Srinivas K.S]<br>
* Developed an AI-based Lie Detection System that predicts truthfulness by analyzing eye movements and facial expressions, using neural networks optimized with genetic algorithms and hill climbing techniques.<br>
* Preprocessed a dataset of interview features, split into training and testing sets, to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency.<br>
* Implemented a neural network with forward propagation, accuracy calculation, and activation functions (sigmoid and ReLU), optimizing performance through crossover and mutation strategies.<br>
* Enhanced the neural networkâ€™s accuracy using hill climbing, iteratively refining weights and biases to achieve better results.<br>
* Built the system using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, demonstrating advanced techniques in neural network optimization for lie detection.

<b>Breast Cancer Classification - Machine Learning Project</b> <br>
Advisor: [Prof. Srikanth H.R]<br>
* Developed a breast cancer classification system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression (LR) to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on cellular characteristics.<br>
* Implemented KNN to calculate Euclidean distances for nearest neighbor classification, and LR to model binary outputs using the sigmoid function for accurate tumor classification.<br>
* Preprocessed the dataset, split data into training and testing sets, and evaluated models using performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score.<br>
* Observed that KNN had a longer execution time due to its lazy learning nature, while Logistic Regression provided faster predictions with comparable accuracy.<br>
* Built the system using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, achieving effective results and providing insights into breast cancer classification.
<br>
* Proposed future work including exploring advanced algorithms like SVM and Neural Networks for improved accuracy.
